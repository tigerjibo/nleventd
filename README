Netlink events
--------------
Each netlink event which is passed to the external appication is represented
with generic set of variables:

Variable name         Values                Description
-------------         ------                -----------
NLMSG_TYPE            ROUTE                 Rtnetlink event type

NLMSG_EVENT           NEWADDR               IPv4/IPv6 address was added
                      DELADDR               IPv4/IPv6 address was removed
                      NEWLINK               Network interface was added
                      DELLINK               Network interface was removed


Different kind of netlink events has additional dirrerent set of variables:

* The 'bool' type means "TRUE" or "FALSE" values.
