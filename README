DESCRIPTION
-----------
nleventd - netlink events dispatcher for external apps. It listens for the
Netlink events and dispatches it to the external application. Netlink event is
passed as set of environment variables which is usefull to use it in the shell
scripts. See doc/nleventd.txt for variables description.

BUILD
-----
To compile it just run 'make'.

TODO
----
* Use Filesystem notifications API to dynamically load changed/added file
  rules.

* Change the rules matching approach. Currently key=value set is allocated for
  each received Netlink message. The better approach should use already
  predefined filters based on file rules for comparing Netlink message and if
  it matches then allocate key=value set and put it to the external
  script/application.

* Add support routing Netlink message.
