Rules
=====
Rules files are used to filter the applications which should be run for
a specific received Netlink message. Each Netlink message is converted
into a key=value form which will be passed as environment variables to the
matched application/script.

By default nleventd reads rules from /etc/nleventd/* or from path specified by -c
option. Each file should contain the set of matching Netlink variables as
key=value pair and path to the application/script.  Here is an generic example
of the rule file :

    # Here is a comment which will be skipped while parsing

    VAR = VALUE
    VAR_1 = VALUE_2
    VAR_2 = VALUE_N

    exec path_to_script

Each key=value is compared as POSIX regular expression. If all key=value's are
matched then they will be passed to executing {path_to_script}. In the executing
script/application they can be used as environment variables:

    #!/bin/bash

    echo "VAR=$VAR"
    echo "VAR_1=$VAR_1"
    echo "VAR_2=$VAR_2"
    echo ""

Under samples/ folder you can find the examples of rules & scripts.

The Netlink protocol type can be recognized by NL_TYPE variable. The values are
described in the following table:

Value   Description  
-----   -----------              
ROUTE   RT Netlink netlink protocol
UEVENT  Uevent Netlink protocol

RT variables
============
Each RT message has EVENT variable which indicates a RT type. The following
table describes the possible values:

Values                Description
------                -----------
NEWADDR               IPv4/IPv6 address was added
DELADDR               IPv4/IPv6 address was removed
NEWLINK               Network interface was added
DELLINK               Network interface was removed
NEWNEIGH              Neighbour was entry added
DELNEIGH              Neighbour was entry removed
NEWROUTE              Route was added
DELROUTE              Route was removed


Different kind of RT netlink events has different set of key=value params:

* The 'bool' type means "TRUE" or "FALSE" values.

Uevent message is already generated in the key=value form so it just passed as it is.
