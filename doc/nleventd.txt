Rules
-----
Before dispatching the Netlink messages nleventd reads rules files from /etc/nleventd
or from path specified by -c option. Each file should contains the set of variables
and path to the application/script which will be invoked if the declared variables will
be matched with received Netlink message by nleventd:

    NL_VAR1 = VALUE
    NL_VAR2 = VALUE2
    NL_VAR_N = VALUE_N

    exec path_to_script

The path_to_script will be invoked if NL_VAR1 & NL_VAR2 & NL_VAR_N
will be matched according to the current received Netlink message
attributes/fields by nleventd.

Netlink events
--------------
Each netlink message field/attribute is converted to separated environment
variable and passed to the executing application/script.

Generic set of variables:

Variable name         Values                Description
-------------         ------                -----------
NL_TYPE               ROUTE                 Rtnetlink event type

NL_EVENT              NEWADDR               IPv4/IPv6 address was added
                      DELADDR               IPv4/IPv6 address was removed
                      NEWLINK               Network interface was added
                      DELLINK               Network interface was removed


Different kind of netlink events has additional dirrerent set of variables:

* The 'bool' type means "TRUE" or "FALSE" values.
