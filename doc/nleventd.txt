Rules
-----
Before dispatching the Netlink messages nleventd reads rules files from
/etc/nleventd or from path specified by -c option. Each file should contain
the set of matching Netlink parameters as key=value pair and path to the
application/script which will be invoked if the declared parameters will be
matched with received Netlink message by nleventd. Here is an shematic
example of the rule file (samples/ folder contains more example rules & scripts):

    # Here is a comment which will be skipped while parsing

    PARAM = VALUE
    PARAM_2 = VALUE_2
    PARAM_N = VALUE_N

    exec path_to_script

Params should be exact matched, values are compared as POSIX regular expressions.
See at samples/ folder which contains examples of rules & scripts.

Netlink events
--------------
Each netlink message field/attribute is converted to separated environment
key=value and passed to the executing application/script as environment variables.

Generic set of params:

Param name            Values                Description
-------------         ------                -----------
NL_TYPE               ROUTE                 Rtnetlink event type

EVENT                 NEWADDR               IPv4/IPv6 address was added
                      DELADDR               IPv4/IPv6 address was removed
                      NEWLINK               Network interface was added
                      DELLINK               Network interface was removed
                      NEWNEIGH              Neighbour entry added
                      DELNEIGH              Neighbour entry removed


Different kind of netlink events has dirrerent set of key=value params:

* The 'bool' type means "TRUE" or "FALSE" values.
